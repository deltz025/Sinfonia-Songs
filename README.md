# Sinfonia Songs

This repository is for storing (and managing updates to) my digitized versions of Phi Mu Alpha's fraterntity songs. 

Note that these files are native to MuseScore 3.x. That means the files *will not* open in previous versions. For the next generation of these files, which take advantage of improved spacing and placement algorithms, check the MU4 branch. 

## FAQ

#### Where are the PDF/MP3/Midi versions?

They may be added to the repo eventually, but are outside the current scope. Those formats are still available at the old Drive-hosted repository, and can be generated using MuseScore. 

#### Where are the songbook scans?

Not hosted here. GitHub provides a generous amount of storage space, but the high-resolution scans would eat up significant storage. 
#### Will X song be added?

Probably not. This repo is exclusively for officialÂ¹ Fraternity songs. Whenever a new edition of the songbook is released, those additional songs will be added. At this point, I'm not considering adding any non-Fraternity songs to the repo, both for the sake of simplicity and because of inevitable copyright restrictions.

1 - Official is a relative term. This repo will include unofficial standards that are common among the majority of chapters.
