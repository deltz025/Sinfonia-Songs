# Sinfonia Songs

This repository is for storing (and managing updates to) my digitized versions of Phi Mu Alpha's fraterntity songs. 

Note that these files are native to MuseScore 3.x. That means the files *will not* open in previous versions. For the next generation of these files, which take advantage of improved spacing and placement algorithms, check the MU4 branch.
